> **⚠️ Seeing a Red "Dangerous Site" Warning?**
>
> Because this project painstakingly recreates the layout using original brand assets (logos/names) for educational realism, Google's automated security bots may flag it as "Phishing." **This is a false positive.**
>
> **How to bypass the warning:**
> 1. Click the **"Details"** button on the red screen.
> 2. Click **"Visit this unsafe site"** (text is often underlined).
>
> *This is a 100% static student portfolio project and is completely safe to view.*
